# PythonProject

Project that checks start tags, data, and word changes after a given amount of seconds
Prompts ask for url of website as well as a number of seconds

If wanting to know more about the options provided such as start tags, the prompt will ask if you want to know about 'start tags'. To select this, type the words: start tags. Please make sure your raw input is written as it appears in the code.

Occasionally, the "changed words" on the website will appear as hex code.
