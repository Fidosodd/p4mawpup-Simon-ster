# PythonProject

Project that checks start tags, data, and word changes after a given amount of seconds
Prompts ask for url of website as well as a number of seconds

If curious about an option such as start tags, the prompt will ask if you want to know about 'start tags'. To select this, type the words: start tags. Please make sure your raw input is written as it appears in the code.
