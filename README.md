# Notes

The project checks start tags, data, and word changes of a given website after a given amount of seconds

Prompts ask for url of website as well as a number of seconds

Url must be given fully

Seconds must be given in integer form

If wanting to know more about the options provided such as start tags, the prompt will ask if you want to know about 'start tags'. 

To select this, type the words: start tags. Please make sure your raw input is written as it appears in the code.    *see below image

_For some situations, the "changed words" on the website will appear in a hex code format._
